# Hello, welcome to my repository.
Don't bother yourself in reading this page - this is only a test, because I'm a total newbie on GitHub. I'm an amateur website developer who likes to create weird and creative things. I still learn, I can't call myself as a professional or something similar. Besides writing code, I do a lot of graphic designs. Just for fun and my personal library.
